# Nearby Registered Locations using GPS
This project displays nearby registered locations using GPS.

## Challenges
Initially, I didn't know how to use the navigation bar, so I switched screens using activities instead of fragments. This approach eventually caused the code to become unstable and collapse.

## Note
The current state of the project is uploaded to GitHub for reference.
